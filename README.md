## mSynth

It supposed to be a real time synth builder.

I dont really want to make it a vst cuz that might mean i need to do licencing things
and im not really about that, but also im not really confidentt in using juce so 
thats another reason (the biggest reason really) so im just going to either create it 
as an exe or a dll file.

Planning on using tinker(python) for the gui, or if i can get glew working
maybe i can use imgui, or some other ui redering. I could also use godot but ill see
how i goes.
